1) Concentrator location problem is formulated as the ILP problem to minimize the total cost of establishing the network topology. Python and PuLP are used to model such a problem. The optimal position(s) of concentrator and the optimal cost could be obtained. 2) Concentrator connection problem is formulated as the ILP problem to find a spanning tree of minimum cost where the network is considered as an undirected graph. The optimal edge(s) and the optimal cost in the tree could be obtained.
